                        <p>Here in NewBreath we are trying to provide information for Melbourne residence who are suffering from breathing issues. The information provided for people is either based on the suburb they select or their current location. By selecting a suburb, people can observe the quality of air of that suburb at the time of searching. We can suggest people whether that particular time of that specific suburb is suitable for outdoor activities. These information are more backed up with list of hospitals, gyms and parks in that particular suburb.</p>
                        <p>A yearly scale of air quality of that suburb will assist people in gaining more knowledge about the quality of air. These information is provided to people in terms of graphs which tell them the quality of air in different seasons.</p>
                        <p>We also provide people with the opportunity to create a personal profile where they can create a diary. the main objective of creating such platform is to allow them to save their medical conditions along with the date. A report over their diaries will allow them to have a more clear understanding of their medical situation, for example, they will gain knowledge about the seasons or weather condition including air pollution when they have asthma attack or breathing difficulties.</p>
